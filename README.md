# AHK-Convertify
An AHK script designed to convert files with Asterisk compatibility in mind. Now with a new multi-select GUI!

Run the .ahk script, and a GUI will pop open that will let you choose input files/folders, output files/folders, or if this is a single conversion. This will use existing code and design language, so it should immediately be familiar.

Currently, the GUI only has feature parity with v1 of the script and none of the radio buttons or checkbox options work. Refactoring is needed on the file load and save portions of the script.
