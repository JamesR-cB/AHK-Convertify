# AHK-Convertify
An AHK script designed to convert files with Asterisk compatibility in mind.

Convertify was originally envisioned as a binary file converter, but ended up being AHK + ffmpeg becasue that was easier, and after all, you don't be serious in AHK, you bodge the shit out of everything.

So, this branch is where I work on stapling my existing codebase onto FFMPEG as well as all of my research into it - since ffmmpeg's documentation is pretty...not great to put it politely.
