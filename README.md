# AHK-Convertify
An AHK script designed to convert files with Asterisk compatibility in mind. Now with a new GUI!

The GUI is now mostly complete (pretty sure it wont change at least lol) and now looks like:

Run the .ahk script, and the above GUI will pop open that will let you choose input files. This will open a Windows-native file selection dialog that supports Ctrl and Shift to select multiple files at once.

v1.3 Beta 1 has added manual handling of output files back into the mix of modes - Automatic handling of output files still exists and works exactly as it did in v1.2, you just now have the option to have the program automatically spit out into the same input directory or a custom one of your choosing.

v1.3Beta 2 will add config support to remember your preference for output directory and options.
